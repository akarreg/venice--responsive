          <h3>.Why Venice.</h3>
          <h2>Venice the city of love.</h2>
          <p>
            Apart from near silence, there’s the all-encompassing presence of
            the water. There is literally a canal around every corner in Venice.
            Your hotel is very likely to afford you some sort of vista of one
            canal or another, so you can watch the gondoliers serenading their
            clients as they punt along the water. </br>Wandering the cosy, cobbled
            lanes of Venice is one of the pleasures of a visit to this beguiling
            city, and the shimmer of the water at the end of an alley or far
            corner of a square is as enticing a sight as you’re likely to behold
            anywhere on earth.
